# README

I have built this website as an external project to explore the Ruby on Rails framework.
I have used bootstrap to style the pages and give it a clean and crisp UI. 

The website makes use of Rails 7 and Bootstrap v5.2. 

Currently this website is locally hosted.

In order to run the website:

Step 1:
git clone https://github.com/joshidevanshi/Friends-App.git
OR 
open with GitHub Desktop 

Step 2:
Launch the terminal of your IDE/command prompt of your device and cd to Friends-App 
This can be done by opening the project on an IDE (eg. VS Code) and using its terminal or simply through the device's command prompt. 

Step 3:
When in Friends-App directory:
Run rails db:migrate

Step 4:
Run rails s or rails server 

Step 5:
Go to your Web browser and type localhost:3000 on the search bar to launch the website. 

Step 6: 
Done!
Give the website a try. 

Step 7:
To stop the website server, press the control C keys.
